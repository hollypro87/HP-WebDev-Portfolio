# Responsive-Porfolio

This assignment has been a total trip. I originally coded everything for css and then realized once I was finishing up that it needed to be bootstrap.

Had a few issues with the bottom of the portfolio page showing correctly on my macbook versus a larger screen. I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to fix it.

I used bootstrap for code to adjust the page layout. Minor tweaks to padding and margins to make everything line up.

I kept going back and forth between having the footer fixed and simply at the bottom of the page. Couldn't decide which looked better.

Wrapped text on "about me" page to agree with the image. Also trying to adjust the margins to get the layout right.

Update:
credit for background animation to https://codepen.io/P1N2O/pen/xxbjYqx
Added background color gradient animation.
Cleaned up code and look of site.
Added a google form as I couldn't get the email function to work.
Adjusted Navbar.
Added images and links for portfolio to current projects and repos.
Overall cleaner feel to the site.
